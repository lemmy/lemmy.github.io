		<p><a href="http://people.inf.ethz.ch/rjan/">Jan Rellermeyer</a> and I are going to present <a href="http://eclipse.org/ecf">ECF</a> at the <a href="http://www.osgi.org/CommunityEvent/HomePage">OSGi community event in Berlin</a>. The talk is titled "<em>Distributed OSGi Services with the Eclipse Communication Framework
(ECF)</em>" and the abstract reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>The Eclipse Communication Framework will soon go into version 2.0,
which will bring the concepts around distributed OSGi services to the
mainstream Eclipse developers. In this talk, we will introduce the various
tools and concepts that ECF provides the users with. Different service
discovery protocols like SLP and mDNS are available for finding remote
services in the network. The interaction with remote services is supported
through distributed shared objects or the R-OSGi system. On top,
applications can either access remote services completely transparently, or
take advantage of an explicit API that allows advanced interaction patterns
like asynchronous calls or futures. We will compare the ECF API with other
related concepts and the ongoing efforts around RFC 119. 
</em></p>
<p>In case you're in the area, make sure to attend. The <a href="http://www.osgi.org/CommunityEvent/Speakers">speakers list</a> includes the who is who of the OSGi community and I'm honored to be given the chance to present the work we've done in ECF. :-)</p>
